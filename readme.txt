Replaces standard Author metabox with the one powered by AutoComplete feature.

== Description ==

Replaces standard Author metabox with the one powered by AutoComplete feature.

Original intention of the plugin is to solve performance issue on sites with thousands, tens of thousands, and more users registered...
Standard Author metabox uses select list which with such quantity of users makes the Edit post page unusable (heavy to load such a long list)...
The new Author metabox uses input field combined with AutoComplete search, what makes it really light and fast even on sites with hundreds of thousands users.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder 'author-autocomplete-metabox' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to "Posts->Edit post" page and see the metabox in action.
